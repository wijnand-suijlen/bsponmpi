 * \section Introduction Introduction
 * BSPonMPI offers on any parallel machine supporting MPI a parallel
 * programming API that adheres to the BSP cost-model. This API is better known
 * as \ref BSPlib and supports Single Program Multiple Data (\ref BSP_SPMD "SPMD")
 * style programs that communicate using Direct Remote Memory Access (\ref
 * BSP_DRMA "DRMA") and Bulk Synchronous Message Passing (\ref BSP_BSMP
 * "BSMP"). This library enables <i>immortal algorithms</i> that once written
 * are scalable everywhere, since the BSP-cost model prescribes that a
 * program's run-time is bounded by 
 * \f[ W + g H + \ell S, \f]
 * where \f$W\f$, the local computation, \f$H\f$, the total communiation
 * volume, and \f$S\f$, the number of supersteps, are determined by the program
 * and \f$g\f$, the <i>message gap</i> (i.e. reciprocal throughput), and
 * \f$\ell\f$, the latency, are determined by the machine. 
 *
 * The API consists of three parts:
 *   - \ref BSP_SPMD "The SPMD Framework"
 *   - \ref BSP_DRMA "Direct Remote Memory Access communications"
 *   - \ref BSP_BSMP "Bulk Sychronous Message Passing communications"
 *
 * In each of these sections, examples are provided how they can be used.
 *
 * Additionally a \ref MCBSP "MulticoreBSP for C compatibility" layer is
 * provided. Use the --mcbsp parameter using the \c bspcc frontend or
 * define the macro \c BSPONMPI_MCBSP_COMPAT to enable this. 
 *
 * Also, check out the \ref BSC "collectives" library for a versatile library
 * of parallel collective operations.
 *
 * \section Example Hello World
 * This example is shamelessly copied from [1].
 * \code
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <bsp.h>
  
   void main(void) { 
     bsp_begin( bsp_nprocs() );
       printf("Hello BSP Worldwide from process %d of %d\n",

/** \defgroup BSP_TYPES BSPlib dialect compatibility
 *
 * The types in this module enable BSPlib dialect oblivious programs. 
 * By default this implementation is compatible with \ref BSPlib 1998,
 * which is ABI incompatible with MulticoreBSP for C's native mode, because it
 * uses types of different signedness and sizes. See the section on 
 * \ref MCBSP "MulticoreBSP for C compatibility" to read how to choose for that
 * dialect. However, to enable dialect oblivious program development the
 * programmer can use these typedefs in the following manner
 *
 * \code
   #if !defined BSPONMPI_BSP_H && !defined _H_MCBSP
     typedef int bsp_pid_t;
     typedef int bsp_nprocs_t;
     typedef int bsp_size_t;
   #endif

   void example( )
   {
      int bla = 42;
      bsp_size_t tagsize = sizeof(bla);
      bsp_nprocs_t n_recvd_msgs = 0;
      bsp_size_t recvd_payload = 0;

      bsp_set_tagsize( &tagsize ); 

      bsp_sync();
      bsp_send(0, &bla, NULL, 0);
      bsp_sync();
   
      bsp_qsize( &n_recvd_msgs, &recvd_payload );

/** \defgroup BSP_SPMD BSPlib SPMD Framework
 *  The SPMD framework enables writing programs in Single Program Multiple Data
 * style. This means that the runtime system will start the same program
 * multiple times and will connect the resulting processes through a communications
 * system (see \ref BSP_DRMA and \ref BSP_BSMP). A process can identify itself
 * only through the the bsp_pid() function, which returns a unique value \f$ 0
 * \leq \texttt{bsp\_pid()} < \texttt{bsp\_nprocs()}\f$ for each process.
 *
 * Because the whole program need not to be SPMD, the programmer should enclose
 * the SPMD part of her program in a function which has as first statement
 * bsp_begin() and as last statement a call to bsp_end(). This function may be
 * main(), but if it is not, the main() function must call bsp_init() as first
 * statement with a reference to the SPMD function. 
 *
 * Example 1
   \code
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <bsp.h>
  
   void main(void) { 
     bsp_begin( bsp_nprocs() );
       printf("Hello BSP Worldwide from process %d of %d\n",
            bsp_pid(), bsp_nprocs() );
     bsp_end();
   }
   \endcode
  
  
   Example 2
   \code
   #include <stdio.h>
   #include <bsp.h>
  
   static int s_nprocs;
   
   void spmd_part( void ) {
     bsp_begin( s_nprocs );
       printf("Hello BSP Worldwide from process %d of %d\n",
              bsp_pid(), bsp_nprocs() );
     bsp_end();
   }
  
   void main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
      bsp_init( spmd_part, argc, argv);

/** \defgroup BSP_BSMP BSPlib Bulk Synchronous Message Passing methods
  * Bulk Synchronous Message Passing allows processes to send each other
  * messages. It differs from message-passing like in e.g. MPI in that there is
  * still only bsp_sync() to synchronize. Point-to-point synchronisations are
  * not possible, since use of those could possibly lead to unacceptable
  * slow-down.

  * Example (from section 4.5.2 in \ref BSPlib "[1]")

          nonzeros, nonzeros_size, status;
      int *sparse_ivec = NULL;

            bsp_send(j, &global_idx, &dense[i], sizeof(float) );

/** Set the tag size of messages for the next superstep and queries the previously
 * set value. The message tag is the fixed size part of a message. By default
 * this value is zero. The function must be collectively called by all processes
 * with the same value. The value returned through \a tag_nbytes is the 
 * value that was given in the previous call to bsp_set_tagsize() or \c 0 if 
 * there were no earlier calls.
 *
 * \note The definitions in the original BSPlib paper and the man page in the
 * Oxford BSP Toolset are rather vague. They both declare that the tag size
 * value becomes valid after the next bsp_sync(). This implies that it could
 * have been invalid before the bsp_sync() and that during that time it was not
 * allowed to send and receive messages. The Oxford BSP Toolset v1.4 implementation
 * implements slightly inconsistent behaviour, because it allows bsp_send() calls
 * immediately following the bsp_set_tagsize() while it does not define whether
 * or how to receive messages after the tag size has changed.
 *
 * \note A much preciser description would be to model this behaviour with a
 * 3-tuple \f$(A, B, C)\f$, where \f$A\f$ is the tag size of the messages
 * in the current receive queue, \f$B\f$ is the tag size of the messages that
 * are being sent now, and \f$C\f$ the tag size that was given in the last call
 * to bsp_set_tagsize(). Directly after the bsp_begin() the state is
 * \f$(0, 0, 0)\f$. A call to \c bsp_set_tagsize(X) changes the state 
 * \f$(A, B, C) \rightarrow (A, B, X)\f$ and returns \f$C\f$. A bsp_sync() changes
 * the state \f$(A, B, C) \rightarrow (B, C, C)\f$.
 *
 * \param tag_nbytes On entry the value is used to set the tag size for after
 * the next bsp_sync(). On exit the value is changed to the value that was
 * given in the previous call to bsp_set_tagsize().
