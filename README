Introduction
============

BSPonMPI offers on any parallel machine supporting MPI a parallel programming
API that adheres to the BSP cost-model. This API is better known as BSPlib and
supports Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) style programs that communicate
using Direct Remote Memory Access (DRMA) and Bulk Synchronous Message Passing
(BSMP). This library enables immortal algorithms that once written are
scalable everywhere, since the BSP-cost model prescribes that a program's
run-time is bounded by 

                                W + g H + L S

where W, the local computation, H, the local communiation volume, and S, the
number of supersteps, are determined by the program and g, the message gap
(i.e. reciprocal throughput), and L, the latency, are determined by the
machine. 

Getting Started
===============

Prerequisites
-------------
  - CMake version 2.8.11

  - An MPI-2 implementation, such as MPICH, OpenMPI, MVAPICH, IBM Platform,
    Intel MPI, Microsoft MPI.
    (note: When using a Linux package manager, make sure you get the '-devel'
     package)

  - A C and C++ compiler
   
  - (Optional) Doxygen 1.8.5 and (Pdf)LaTeX for generating MAN pages,
    browseable HTML, and a PDF of the API reference documentation.


Installation
------------
Like installation of any project from source-code, the installation breaks down
in configuration, compilation, and installation. For the configuration step,
this project uses CMake. The procedure for Windows is described in the OS
specific installation hints below.  On Unix-like systems, like Linux and macOS,
do the following to install BSPonMPI in the default directories

   $ ./configure 
   $ sudo make install

To install in a different directory, do

   $ ./configure --prefix=<installdir>
   $ make install

Here <installdir> should be replaced with the installation directory.
If <installdir>/bin wasn't already in your PATH environment variable, 
you should add it yourself. Likewise, MANPATH should be extended with
<installdir>/share/man.
  
For further OS specific hints, see the OS specific installation hints section.

Compiling programs
------------------

Assuming you have a source file helloworld.c, you can compile it as follows
  
  $ bspcc helloworld.c -o helloworld

Likewise, if you have a C++ source file helloworld.cpp, you can do

  $ bspcxx helloworld.cpp -o helloworld


Running programs
----------------

Programs can be run through the bsprun command, which is a simple wrapper
around mpirun/mpiexec

  $ bsprun -n 5 ./helloworld


High Performance
----------------

High performance can only be achieved if bsprun is invoked with the correctly
tuned cost-function parameters. See the manuals of bompiprobe and bsprun on how
to obtain correct estimates and how to apply them.


Installation customization
==========================

bspcc, bspcxx, and bsprun are simple bash scripts that wrap around mpicc,
mpicxx, and mpirun/mpiexec and can be edited manually if necessary.

For customization of bsprun there are also two CMake variables
 
  - MPIRUN_EXECUTABLE  sets the MPI program launcher

  - MPIRUN_NPROCS_PARAM  sets the parameter required to set the number of MPI
    processes. For example, if the MPI launcher requires "-np 5" to launch 5
    processes, this parameter should be set to "-np;". The semicolon here
    denotes that the 5 must be a separate command line parameter. Leaving out
    the semicolon allows use of a hypothetical mpirun parameter "--nprocs=5"
    for which MPIRUN_NPROCS_PARAM has to be set to "--nprocs=".

CMake Variables can be set using the configure script

  $ ./configure -D<var1>=<value1> -D<var2>=<value2> ...

Alternatively, these can be changed using `ccmake' or, on Windows, with
cmake-gui.


Build options for contributors
==============================

Although an in-source build is supported to simplify installations from source,
it is encouraged to use out-of-source builds during development.  Simply make a
new directory anywhere, change to it, and run configure from there. This script
infers the source directory from its own parent directory and passes it on to
CMake. Out-of-source builds protect against overwriting source files with
generated files, easy and thorough cleaning because all generated file are in
the build directory, and it is possible to maintain builds in different
configurations.

The CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE CMake variable can be set to Debug to enable assertions
and include debugging symbols.

An automated Unit test and regression test suite is available. Run 'make test'
or 'ctest' to run all tests. The 'ctest' driver allows more precise control
over which tests to run.

On systems with rpmbuild or dpkg-deb available an .rpm or .deb package will be
generated with 'make package'. A source tarball is generated with 'make
package_source'.


OS specific installation hints
==============================

Mac OS X / macOS / Darwin
-------------------------
The MacPorts collection provides easy access to Unix development tools, which
are necessary to build, install, and use BSPonMPI. See https://macports.org
MacPorts also needs Xcode to be installed, but that can be downloaded for free
from the App Store. Once you have both installed, you can install the required
dependencies through MacPorts: 

 $ sudo port install cmake mpich-devel-default doxygen texlive-basic

Doxygen and texlive-basic are only required to generate API reference
documentation. The texlive-basic package is quite large and only required
to generate a PDF. Without it, Doxygen will stil be able to  generate Unix man
pages and HTML.

See the previous installation section how to proceed installation.


CentOS 7
--------

To install the necessary prerequisites do:

  $ sudo yum install cmake mpich-3.0-devel doxygen-latex

Then before you can run the cmake commands, you have to load MPI into your
shell environment

  $ module load mpi



Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic Beaver)   and  Debian 9 (stretch)
----------------------------------------------------------

Make sure you have CMake, Doxygen, and an MPI installed. E.g. do

  $ sudo apt install cmake doxygen mpich doxygen-latex

Then proceed as usual


FreeBSD 12.0
------------

Use the FreeBSD package manager `pkg' to download and install
the prerequisites. 

Do as root
  $ pkg install cmake mpich 
  
To generate the full documentation, also do 
  $ pkg install doxygen texlive-full-20150521  

Then proceed as usual.

In case you get strange (runtime) linking errors, be prepared to reinstall mpich
from source. In the version I tried (3.2.1_3) the clang 6 and gcc 8 toolchains
got mixed up. 


Windows 10
----------

This is tested with Microsoft MPI 10.0.0. There is also a Windows version from
IBM.  You can get MS MPI from
  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/message-passing-interface

Get other development tools: Visual Studio & CMake. If you like to generate
HTML documentation, then also download Doxygen, a Tex distribution (e.g.
MikTex), and Ghostscript. Make sure the executables of these tools are in
your PATH environment variable.
  - Enable Desktop C++ development in VS (Tools->Get Tools and Features)
  - Run CMake-gui. Select the source folder and the build directory, and
    run configure and generate. This will generate a Visual Studio solution
    for a 32-bit or 64-bit build in the build directory
  - Open the VS solution
  - Choose a configuration (Release, Debug)
  - Build it (CTRL+SHIFT+B)
    
     Note: if you get lots of error messages "Object reference not set to an
     instance of an object", update your Visual Studio to the latest version.

  - If you had set CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable during CMake configuration,
    you can then build the INSTALL project to copy the resulting files
    to that directory.
    The resulting DLLs will be in the \bin directory, the .LIB files are in the
    \lib directory, and the bsp.h header will be in the \include directory.
    Documentation will be in \share\doc\bsponmpi.

    Without running the INSTALL project, the .LIB and .DLL files will be in 
    either the Release or Debug subdirectory in the build directory.


To use the library in your Visual Studio project 
(see also https://blogs.technet.microsoft.com/windowshpc/2015/02/02/how-to-
compile-and-run-a-simple-ms-mpi-program/)
  - Create a new Windows Console application project with Visual C++
  - Add include path in the project properties -> C/C++ -> General ->
    Additional Include Directories
  - Add the path to the bsponmpi_*.LIB files  to the "Additional Library
    Directores" field in the project properties -> Linker -> General, and add
    the .LIB file of one of the four built flavours: bsponmpi_msg.lib,
    bsponmpi_rma.lib, bsponmpi_msg_prof.lib, or bsponmpi_rma_prof.lib. If
    you're not sure, choose bsponmpi_rma.lib
  - Build your program
  - When you want to run the program, make sure the bsponmpi_*.dll is in the
    same path as your executable. Then use the MPI launcher to run your program,
    i.e.: Start a command prompt and run "mpiexec -n 5 helloworld.exe"
