.TH BSPRUN 1 
.SH NAME
bsprun \- The BSPonMPI program launcher
.
.SH SYNOPSIS
.BR bsprun 
.RI [ OPTIONS ...]
.IR command ...
.fi
.
.SH DESCRIPTION
Runs a BSPlib program that has been compiled with BSPonMPI's 
.B bspcc
or
.B bspcxx
compiler frontend.
It is essentally a wrapper around the
.I mpirun
from the MPI implementation that was used to build BSPonMPI.
For directions on how to launch a program, it is, therefore, essential
to consult the 
.I mpirun
(1) manual as well. However, the following will just work:
.PP
.nf
.RS
$ bsprun -n 5 ./a.out
.RE
.fi
.PP
which runs ./a.out with 5 processes.
If the system requires a different launcher, then the user
is invited to copy the 
.B bsprun
shell script and to modify it accordingly. 
Alternatively, the 
.B \-\-show
option can be used to generate a template launch script.
.
.SH OPTIONS
Only 
.B bsprun
specific options are listed here. 
All unrecognized options are passed on to the
.I mpirun
command.
.TP
.BI \-n\  nprocs ,\ \-\-nprocs= nprocs
Launches the program with at most \fInprocs\fR processes.
.TP
.BR \-\-help
Gives a brief usage overview.
.TP
.BR \-\-version
Shows version information.
.TP
.BR \-\-show
Instead of launching the command it show what exactly will be executed.
.TP
.BR \-\-max\-msg\-size=\fIbytes\fR
Restricts the runtime to messages equal or less than \fIbytes\fR bytes.
It may be necessary to change this value to improve speed or work 
around MPI implementation specific stabilty issues.
By default this value is equal to 
.I INT_MAX.
.TP
.BR \-\-small\-exchange\-size=\fIbytes\fR
Specifies the maximum number of \fIbytes\fR per process
that is still considered to be a small exchange.
For small exchanges an 
.I MPI_Alltoall 
(3) is used, for which there is an O(log p) algorithm on high-bandwidth
networks, where p is the number of processes.
For large exchanges throughput
optimal methods, such as 
.I MPI_Put
(3) when linked with \-\-rma or
.I MPI_Irsend
(3) and
.I MPI_Irecv
(3) when linked with \-\-msg are used. 
These have, however, also a higher latency of O(p). 
Hence, the general advice is to increase this value if your application
is sensitive to synchronisation latency.
By default a communication of 1024 bytes per process or less is a small
exchange.
.
.SH ENVIRONMENT
.B bsprun
is essentially a wrapper around 
.I mpirun
(1) but sets an additional set of environment variables:
.TP
.B BSPONMPI_MAX_MSG_SIZE
Sets the maximum message size. See the description of 
.B \-\-max-msg-size
above.
.TP
.B BSPONMPI_SMALL_EXCHANGE_SIZE
Sets the maximum for small exchanges. See the description of
.B \-\-small\-exchange\-size
above.
.P
In order for the dynamic linker to find the BSPonMPI dynamic
library the
.B DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH
and
.B LD_LIBRARY_PATH
variables are extended to include the path to the library.
